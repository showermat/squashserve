<h1>Add Volume</h1>
<div>
<p>The only properties that are strictly required are the HTML directory, the volume ID, and the path to the home HTML.  The HTML directory is the absolute path to the location on the server where the site files are stored; the volume ID is an alphanumeric identifier for the volume to be used by the program (often an abbreviated version of the volume title); the home HTML path is the location of the "home page" HTML file relative to the HTML directory.  For example, the HTML directory might be <span class="code">/home/user/my-site</span>, and the home HTML might be <span class="code">en/index.html</span>.  You are also strongly encouraged to provide a title and the absolute path to a 48x48 (or larger) PNG icon image.  The remaining properties are only conventional.  You may add an unlimited number of arbitrary properties whose names consist only of letters (case-insensitive) and underscores and do not begin with an underscore.  These will be made available to home.html and view.html as tokens of the form <span class="code">%TOKEN</span>.  The HTML directory should not contain a file or directory named <span class="code">_meta</span> unless you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the archive will be created and the list of volumes will be automatically refreshed.  This can take many minutes, so please be patient!</p>
